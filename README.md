# Kwenta Subgraph

## Overview

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data on the Ethereum blockchain. Subgraphs define the data The Graph will index and how it will be stored. This data is then provided via a GraphQL API.

The Graph currently consists of a hosted service and a decentralized network. In the future, the hosted service will be gradually sunset after the decentralized network achieves feature parity.

### Hosted Service

The Kwenta subgraphs are available on the hosted service:

Ethereum mainnet:

- **[mainnet](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/kwenta/mainnet-main)**

Optimism mainnet:

- **[Optimism Main](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/kwenta/optimism-main)**
- **[Optimism Perps](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/kwenta/optimism-perps)**
- **[Optimism Latest Rates](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/kwenta/optimism-latest-rates)**

Optimism Goerli:

- **[Optimism Goerli Main](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/kwenta/optimism-goerli-main)**
- **[Optimism Goerli Perps](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/kwenta/optimism-goerli-perps)**
- **[Optimism Goerli Latest Rates](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/kwenta/optimism-goerli-latest-rates)**

**⚠️ Using subgraphs with the hosted service may introduce breaking changes.** The Kwenta subgraphs are under active development. Because The Graph does not currently support pinning subgraph versions on the hosted service, these subgraphs should be used with caution.

### Satsuma

Kwenta subgraphs are also deployed to a hosted service at Satsuma. Production deployments of Kwenta may point at these private endpoints.

## Usage

### Query the hosted service directly

This code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve all exchanges that occured in the last 24 hours:

```javascript
(async () => {
  const ts = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1e3);
  const oneDayAgo = ts - 3600 * 24;
  const body = JSON.stringify({
    query: `{
      futuresTrades (
        orderBy:timestamp,
        orderDirection:desc,
        where:{timestamp_gt: ${oneDayAgo}}
      )
      {
        id
        timestamp
        account
        orderType
        size
        positionSize
        price
        pnl
      }
    }`,
    variables: null,
  });

  const response = await fetch('https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/kwenta/optimism-perps', {
    method: 'POST',
    body,
  });

  const json = await response.json();
  const { futuresTrades } = json.data;
  // ...
  console.log(futuresTrades);
})();
```

Explore all of the entities available in the subgraph in [the playground](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/kwenta/optimism-perps/graphql).

_Due to limitation imposed by The Graph, only 1,000 results will be returned from the query above. Review [The Graph's documentation on pagination](https://thegraph.com/docs/graphql-api#pagination) for more information._

### Candle

The Candle entity stores pricing data for each futures market provided by Chainlink oracles over various time periods. This contains all of the data necessary to generate the candlestick charts on Kwenta's [futures markets](https://kwenta.io/market/sETH)

- `id` (string) - The unique identifier for this candle, represented as _synth_-_period_-_periodId_. (_periodId_ is calculated by dividing the current timestamp by the period.)
- `synth` (string) - The ticker symbol for synth (e.g. sUSD) or SNX.
- `period` (integer) - The duration this candle is tracking, in seconds. Various time periods are available, ranging from 1 minute to 30 days.
- `open` (integer) - The price reported at the beginning of this period. Because of oracle update frequency, this will usually be the `close` price of the previous candle.
- `high` (integer) - The highest price reported during this period.
- `low` (integer) - The lowest price reported during this period.
- `close` (integer) - The price reported at the end of this period.
- `timestamp` (integer) - The timestamp, in seconds, at the beginning of this period.
- `average` (integer) - The average of the prices reported during this period.
- `aggregatedPrices` (integer) - The number of times the price was reported during this period. (See the Rate Updates entity for individual price reports.)

**Notes:**

- Oracles will often update less frequently than shorter timeframe candles (1m, 5m). In these cases, we fill the gap from the previous update with candles where all values are the price of the last oracle update.

## Synthetix Perps

### FuturesPosition

The FuturesPosition entity stores the current state of every Synthetix perpetual futures position. A new position is created when a position is opened, and is considered closed when the trader modifies the position to have a `size` of zero or gets liquidated. Cross margin positions are given to the account owner.

- `id` (id) - Unique identifier for this position in the format _market_-_positionId_ where _positionId_ is an incrementing index tracked by the contract.

- `closeTimestamp` (integer) - UTC timestamp when the position was closed.
- `timestamp` (integer) - UTC timestamp of the last interaction with this position.
- `market` (bytes) - Address of the futures market for this position.
- `marketKey` (bytes) - A hex encoding of the name of the underlying market: `sETHPERP` -> `0x...`.

- `pnl` (integer) - Realized profit/loss of this position in sUSD.
- `feesPaid` (integer) - Total fees paid across all trades on this position in sUSD.
- `pnlWithFeesPaid` (integer) - Realized profit/loss of this position in sUSD after fees are applied.
- `netFunding` (integer) - Total funding accrued since this position was opened to the trader's last modification.

- `totalDeposits` (integer) - Total deposits to the margin account since this position was opened.
- `fundingIndex` (integer) - The index in the "funding array" at the last interaction with this position. This value is used to calculate funding each time a trader modifies their position.
- `entryPrice` (integer) - Price of the asset in sUSD when the position was opened.
- `avgEntryPrice` (integer) - Average price in sUSD of the asset across interactions with this position. (note below)
- `lastPrice` (integer) - Price of the asset in sUSD at the last interaction with this position.
- `exitPrice` (integer) - Price of the asset in sUSD when this position was closed.

**Notes:**

- These entities store all futures positions, not just those opened on Kwenta.
- This entity tracks values to the last interaction by the trader (order, margin transfer, trade) but does not include any profit/loss or funding accrued since that interaction.
- There is unrealized funding and pnl that is not stored on these entities. They are a "snapshot" of the position at the last interaction.
- Average entry price is updated when a trader _increases_ their position, or is reset to the entry price when the trader changes sides. For example, if a trader modifies a short position into a long position their new `avgEntryPrice` will be the current price at modification.

## Development

### Hosted Service Deployment

First, set your access token for the hosted service:
`npm run auth <ACCESS_TOKEN>`

To build and deploy the subgraphs:

- Run `npm run deploy` for a CLI
- Follow prompts to choose a subgraph, target (The Graph), and network
- "Team name" must match the team name from the auth access token
- Version label does not matter on the hosted service
- Subgraph will build and deploy, providing a link at completion

Notes:

- New deployments will replace old ones as soon as syncing is complete.
- The CLI can automatically generate the `main` subgraph, which is composed of the other subgraph in the `subgraphs` directory. You can also use the CLI to deploy the component subgraphs to the hosted service for faster development and testing.
- All of the prompts in the CLI can be provided via options. For more information, run `npm run deploy -- --help`.
- PRs to the `main` branch of this repository will result in deploys of various subgraphs. Check [github actions](https://github.com/Kwenta/kwenta-subgraph/actions) to monitor deployments.

### Satsuma Deployment

Satsuma deployments are not triggered by any workflows. These deployments require additional environment variables. Copy and fill in the `.env.example` file before deploying to Satsuma

To build and deploy the subgraphs:

- Run `npm run deploy` for a CLI
- Follow prompts to choose a subgraph, target (The Graph), and network
- "Team name" does not matter on Satsuma.
- Input a version label. The label can not match an existing deployment.
- Subgraph will build and deploy, providing a link at completion

Notes:

- There is no CI set up for Satsuma, so deploys must be run manually.
- New deployments will create a new version syncing on Satsuma. When complete, you can check the version using the version-specific URL. Click "Promote to live" in the Satsuma UI to upgrade the production deployment.

### Codegen

To generate a set of subgraph functions for a frontend, use the following commands but replace the endpoint:

```
npx codegen-graph-ts pull https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/example-team/example-subgraph > manifest.json
npx codegen-graph-ts gen -s manifest.json -o subgraph.ts
```
